# Overview

SteathGame (yet to be named) is a game with a custom made engine that was made as a learning experience to learn more about how 3D rendering works from the graphics API up to the application. The libraries I used you can find below.

# Build

To build this project, run the appropriate script `Scripts/Setup-<platform>` to generate either a Makefile or Visual Studio Solution. Once one of those is setup, either run `make` or build the solution to run the project.

### Note about Platform
The game is made for 64-bit Windows. The project is made with this in mind, and I don't plan on making this game for Linux or Mac until I figure out the Windows game.
